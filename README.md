## Hi there 👋

🔭 My name is Brandon and I am a huge fan of the open source community. The public projects I have here are basically just projects I put together at some point to make my life a bit easier(or to just mess around). Hopefully some of the projects can be useful to you as well📖

## ⚡ Fun fact:

🔑 The Feistel cipher is hands down my favorite cipher (or rather cipher "framework")  
🔐 I also have a lot of interest in AES(Rijndael) encryption and the Kerberos protocol
